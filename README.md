DerpyOS
=======

DerpyOS is an OS for the [ComputerCraft](http://www.computercraft.info/) Minecraft mod. It is written completely in Lua and no modification of the ComputerCraft rom files are necessary to run it. The OS itself is written completely on a ComputerCraft computer!

Installation
------------

### First time/without an existing DerpyOS computer ###
To install, copy the `startup` file and the `sys/` and `user/` directories to the computer folder for the ID you want to install it on.

This folder is located in `world/computer/<id>`. If you don't know the computer ID, start `lua` from CraftOS and type `os.computerID()` and press Enter. The first number will be your computer ID.

### With an existing DerpyOS computer ###
Insert a floppy disk in a disk drive beside the existing DerpyOS computer, run `mkinstall` from the shell, and follow the prompt.
